# Maryland-Circuit-Court-Data-Scrape
# The uploaded file uses RSelenium to scrape data from MD Case Search. You can specify a start date and an end date as well as the type of cases you would like. You must search county by county. Note: this works for all but Prince George's and Montgomery County. Feel free to contact me if you have any troubles.
